This is a Slack bot that helps onboard new hires at 18F through scheduled Slack
messages about topics relevant to 18F and GSA employees. Messages will be
scheduled once per day and will trickle out to employees over the course of 60
days.

Mrs. Landingham will teach 18F employees about working in the federal
government, how to set up travel, how to add their biographical information and
pictures to our website, and other facts that will help them get acclimated to
both 18F and the federal government.

Please file an issue if you have any questions about Mrs. Landingham.

The name of this bot is a friendly reference to the TV show *The West Wing*, where Mrs. Landingham is the fictional president's trusted secretary. This photo is from the show.

Only admin users can add and update scheduled messages. If you would like to
